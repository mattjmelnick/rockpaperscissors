# rockpaperscissors

This program simulates a console-based rock paper scissors game. The player is prompted to choose rock, paper, or scissors, and a round is played against the computer that randomly chooses from RPS.

After each round, the player can change their input, and the program plays 5 rounds. The winner is declared at the end of the 5 rounds, and the score is tracked after each round.

Beginner concepts were introduced and implemented during this project - string manipulation, conditionals, functions and scope, variable assignment, etc.
